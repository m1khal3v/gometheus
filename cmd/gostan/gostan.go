gostan is a tool for static analysis of Go programs.

gostan examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs,
such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format
string. It uses heuristics that do not guarantee all reports are
genuine problems, but it can find errors not caught by the compilers.

Analyzers:
SA1000       Invalid regular expression
SA1001       Invalid template
SA1002       Invalid format in time.Parse
SA1003       Unsupported argument to functions in encoding/binary
SA1004       Suspiciously small untyped constant in time.Sleep
SA1005       Invalid first argument to exec.Command
SA1006       Printf with dynamic first argument and no further arguments
SA1007       Invalid URL in net/url.Parse
SA1008       Non-canonical key in http.Header map
SA1010       (*regexp.Regexp).FindAll called with n == 0, which will always return zero results
SA1011       Various methods in the 'strings' package expect valid UTF-8, but invalid input is provided
SA1012       A nil context.Context is being passed to a function, consider using context.TODO instead
SA1013       io.Seeker.Seek is being called with the whence constant as the first argument, but it should be the second
SA1014       Non-pointer value passed to Unmarshal or Decode
SA1015       Using time.Tick in a way that will leak. Consider using time.NewTicker, and only use time.Tick in tests, commands and endless functions
SA1016       Trapping a signal that cannot be trapped
SA1017       Channels used with os/signal.Notify should be buffered
SA1018       strings.Replace called with n == 0, which does nothing
SA1019       Using a deprecated function, variable, constant or field
SA1020       Using an invalid host:port pair with a net.Listen-related function
SA1021       Using bytes.Equal to compare two net.IP
SA1023       Modifying the buffer in an io.Writer implementation
SA1024       A string cutset contains duplicate characters
SA1025       It is not possible to use (*time.Timer).Reset's return value correctly
SA1026       Cannot marshal channels or functions
SA1027       Atomic access to 64-bit variable must be 64-bit aligned
SA1028       sort.Slice can only be used on slices
SA1029       Inappropriate key in call to context.WithValue
SA1030       Invalid argument in call to a strconv function
SA1031       Overlapping byte slices passed to an encoder
SA1032       Wrong order of arguments to errors.Is
SA2000       sync.WaitGroup.Add called inside the goroutine, leading to a race condition
SA2001       Empty critical section, did you mean to defer the unlock?
SA2002       Called testing.T.FailNow or SkipNow in a goroutine, which isn't allowed
SA2003       Deferred Lock right after locking, likely meant to defer Unlock instead
SA3000       TestMain doesn't call os.Exit, hiding test failures
SA3001       Assigning to b.N in benchmarks distorts the results
SA4000       Binary operator has identical expressions on both sides
SA4001       &*x gets simplified to x, it does not copy x
SA4003       Comparing unsigned values against negative values is pointless
SA4004       The loop exits unconditionally after one iteration
SA4005       Field assignment that will never be observed. Did you mean to use a pointer receiver?
SA4006       A value assigned to a variable is never read before being overwritten. Forgotten error check or dead code?
SA4008       The variable in the loop condition never changes, are you incrementing the wrong variable?
SA4009       A function argument is overwritten before its first use
SA4010       The result of append will never be observed anywhere
SA4011       Break statement with no effect. Did you mean to break out of an outer loop?
SA4012       Comparing a value against NaN even though no value is equal to NaN
SA4013       Negating a boolean twice (!!b) is the same as writing b. This is either redundant, or a typo.
SA4014       An if/else if chain has repeated conditions and no side-effects; if the condition didn't match the first time, it won't match the second time, either
SA4015       Calling functions like math.Ceil on floats converted from integers doesn't do anything useful
SA4016       Certain bitwise operations, such as x ^ 0, do not do anything useful
SA4017       Discarding the return values of a function without side effects, making the call pointless
SA4018       Self-assignment of variables
SA4019       Multiple, identical build constraints in the same file
SA4020       Unreachable case clause in a type switch
SA4021       'x = append(y)' is equivalent to 'x = y'
SA4022       Comparing the address of a variable against nil
SA4023       Impossible comparison of interface value with untyped nil
SA4024       Checking for impossible return value from a builtin function
SA4025       Integer division of literals that results in zero
SA4026       Go constants cannot express negative zero
SA4027       (*net/url.URL).Query returns a copy, modifying it doesn't change the URL
SA4028       x % 1 is always zero
SA4029       Ineffective attempt at sorting slice
SA4030       Ineffective attempt at generating random number
SA4031       Checking never-nil value against nil
SA4032       Comparing runtime.GOOS or runtime.GOARCH against impossible value
SA5000       Assignment to nil map
SA5001       Deferring Close before checking for a possible error
SA5002       The empty for loop ('for {}') spins and can block the scheduler
SA5003       Defers in infinite loops will never execute
SA5004       'for { select { ...' with an empty default branch spins
SA5005       The finalizer references the finalized object, preventing garbage collection
SA5007       Infinite recursive call
SA5008       Invalid struct tag
SA5009       Invalid Printf call
SA5010       Impossible type assertion
SA5011       Possible nil pointer dereference
SA5012       Passing odd-sized slice to function expecting even size
SA6000       Using regexp.Match or related in a loop, should use regexp.Compile
SA6001       Missing an optimization opportunity when indexing maps by byte slices
SA6002       Storing non-pointer values in sync.Pool allocates memory
SA6003       Converting a string to a slice of runes before ranging over it
SA6005       Inefficient string comparison with strings.ToLower or strings.ToUpper
SA6006       Using io.WriteString to write []byte
SA9001       Defers in range loops may not run when you expect them to
SA9002       Using a non-octal os.FileMode that looks like it was meant to be in octal.
SA9003       Empty body in an if or else branch
SA9004       Only the first constant has an explicit type
SA9005       Trying to marshal a struct with no public fields nor custom marshaling
SA9006       Dubious bit shifting of a fixed size integer value
SA9007       Deleting a directory that shouldn't be deleted
SA9008       else branch of a type assertion is probably not reading the right value
